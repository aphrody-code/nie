description: MANDATORY first step whenever the user asks ANYTHING about a library, framework, SDK, CLI tool, cloud service, API, configuration syntax, runtime behavior, version migration, or "how do I do X with Y" — single tool call `mcp__aphrody__docs_auto_search` fans out Context7 (community catalog, version-pinned) + Microsoft Learn (official Azure / .NET / Windows / M365 / Power Platform docs + code samples) + Google search IN PARALLEL via `tokio::join!`, returns one fused markdown report. Covers EVERYTHING — Rust crates (tokio, wgpu, reqwest, axum, serde, hyper, rmcp, …), JS frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, …), Python libs (FastAPI, Django, polars, pandas, numpy, …), Azure / AWS / GCP services, .NET APIs, Windows kernel + Win32, mobile SDKs (Swift / Kotlin / Flutter), database engines, build tools. Use EVEN WHEN you think you know the answer — training data is months behind release cycles and APIs drift constantly. Skipping this skill = high risk of hallucinated methods, dead URLs, deprecated patterns. Saves wall-clock time (one parallel call vs three sequential) and saves context window (one summary vs four backend descriptors).

# docs-auto — fanout documentation lookup

Mode `/goal` permanent : décider seul, ne pas s'arrêter avant réponse complète.

A single `mcp__aphrody__docs_auto_search` call replaces a sequence of
manual Context7 / Microsoft Learn / Google queries. Internally the
`aphrody-mcp` binary runs all four backends in parallel via
`tokio::join!` and stitches the responses into one markdown report.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill (and call `docs_auto_search` immediately) whenever
the user :

- Asks an API / config / setup question that mentions a library or
  service by name (React, tokio, Cosmos DB, EF Core, Tailwind, …).
- Says "how do I", "what's the", "where can I find" anything related
  to a developer tool, SDK, or cloud service.
- Needs a code sample / example for a known framework or platform.
- Wants the latest version of an API they haven't used in a while.

Use this **before** falling back to the single-source skills
(`microsoft-docs`, `microsoft-code-reference`, `context7-mcp`) — those
remain available for **drill-down** after the fanout report identifies
a single canonical source.

## Call Signature

```
mcp__aphrody__docs_auto_search({
  query:        "Free-form natural-language question",
  library_name: "Optional library / framework / SDK name",  // unlocks Context7 deep-fetch
  language:     "Optional language filter for MS code samples",
})
```

## What You Get Back

A single markdown document with four sections :

1. **Context7** — community docs catalog. If `library_name` is set,
   includes the resolved library ID and a full `query-docs` fetch.
   Otherwise, just the resolution candidates.
2. **Microsoft Learn — concept / API search** — up to 10 high-quality
   doc chunks with title, URL and excerpt.
3. **Microsoft Learn — code samples** — official Microsoft / Azure code
   snippets matching the query (filtered by `language` if provided).
4. **Google — web search** — web search API fallback, automatically
   appends "documentation API reference" to the query.

## Example Invocations

```js
// Generic — Context7 only resolves (no deep fetch)
docs_auto_search({
  query: "How do I structure a tokio task tree with structured concurrency?"
})

// Library-pinned — Context7 does resolve + deep fetch
docs_auto_search({
  query: "JoinSet vs spawn",
  library_name: "tokio",
  language: "rust"
})

// Azure / .NET centric
docs_auto_search({
  query: "Cosmos DB partition key design best practices",
  language: "csharp"
})

// Web framework
docs_auto_search({
  query: "Route configuration and nesting",
  library_name: "React Router",
  language: "typescript"
})
```

## When to Drill Down

After the fused report, if the user wants the **full reference page**
for a specific URL surfaced in section 2 or 3, follow up with :

- `mcp__aphrody__microsoft_docs_fetch({ url })` — full Microsoft Learn page
- `mcp__aphrody__context7_query_docs({ library_id, query })` — targeted Context7 slice
- `mcp__aphrody__universal_web_fetch({ url })` — any other URL

## Why Use This Instead of Manual Multi-Call

| Cost              | Manual (3 tool calls)            | `docs_auto_search` (1 call)        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Wall-clock        | sum of latencies (serial)        | max of latencies (parallel)        |
| Tool descriptors  | 3 in the model's working set     | 1                                  |
| Decision overhead | model picks the right backend   | server fans out automatically      |
| Error handling    | propagates one error per call    | all four reported in a single body |

The fanout is **free** server-side : same `reqwest` client pool, same
TLS session pool, same tokio runtime. The cost is purely the upstream
quota burn (which you'd pay either way if you eventually called all
three).
