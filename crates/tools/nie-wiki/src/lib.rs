//! `nie-wiki` — IEVR game-data exploration over the read-only SQLite mirror.
//!
//! Ports the `chara`, `skill`, `item`, `team`, `compare`, `search`, `db`,
//! `random-team`, `team-builder`, `status`, `redis`, `audit` and `dialogue`
//! operations from the Azalee CLI to Rust, reading the local `inagle_*` mirror.
//!
//! ## Compatibility rules retained from the original implementation
//!
//! - Null `category_id`/`element_id` values fall back to localized text columns.
//! - `data` and `sheet_data` are merged, with non-empty `sheet_data` taking precedence.
//! - Missing `*_clean` views are represented with a `GROUP BY name_fr` query.
//! - Search filters preserve underscores because aura IDs contain them.
//! - `random-team` uses an explicit `SmallRng::seed_from_u64` seed.
//! - `db [sql]` accepts read-only statements only.
//!
//! The native IEVR wiki surface is split by source truth. The mirror-backed
//! aura, tactic and passive APIs live in [`auras`], [`tactics`] and [`passives`].
//! Static TypeScript enrichments, CDN URLs, GLB manifests and network-only joins
//! are not present in this crate and are never represented as fabricated Rust data.
