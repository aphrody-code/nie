# Migration references — third-party source material

These files describe the **MUI source idioms** that the `migrate-mui` skill
migrates _away from_. They are not part of the M3 system; they are vendored as a
faithful, attributed reference so the migration knows exactly what the source
code looks like (the `sx`/`styled`/`theme` styling wall is the real migration
cost, as measured on the anonymized reference corpus).

## How the skill uses these

- `mui-docs-index.md` resolves "what is MUI `<X>`?" to the upstream doc page, so
  the migration maps each MUI component to its M3 counterpart (see
  `migration/mui-m3-map.json` for the consolidated mapping).
- `mui-upstream/material-ui-styling` and `material-ui-theming` document the
  exact `sx` / `styled` / `createTheme` patterns to detect and rewrite to
  Tailwind on the host + `--md-sys-*` tokens (cf. `m3/no-sx-prop`,
  `migration/06-tailwind-material-web.md`).
- `mui-upstream/material-ui-tailwind` informs the Tailwind interop layer.
- `mui-upstream/material-ui-nextjs` informs framework wiring during a port.
