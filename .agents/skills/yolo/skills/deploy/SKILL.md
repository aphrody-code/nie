# Deploy to Production

Mode `/goal` permanent : décider seul, ne pas demander confirmation, aller jusqu'à validation complète.

Launch the `deployment-engineer` agent to handle the full deployment pipeline.

## Pre-flight Context

Git status: !`git status --short 2>/dev/null`
Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null`
Uncommitted changes: !`git diff --stat 2>/dev/null | tail -1`

## Instructions

1. Launch the `deployment-engineer` agent
2. Pass it the deployment target based on user request:
   - a specific service / binary name → that target only
   - "all" or unspecified → the full release set
3. The deployment-engineer will handle: pre-flight → build → deploy → validate
